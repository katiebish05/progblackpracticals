    <h1>A Very Basic Summary of Rugby</h1>
    <h2>Basic Rules</h2>
    <p>Here is a summary of the most basic, and fundamental rules of rugby</p>
    <ul>
        
        <li>The aim of the game is to have more points than the other team after an 80 minute match
            <br> Points can be scored in the following ways:
            <ul>
                <li>Try - 5 points - by touching the ball on the ground beyond your try line</li>
                <li>Conversion - 2 points - by kicking through the posts after a try has been scored</li>
                <li>Penalty - 3 points - a team can choose to kick to the posts if the other team concedes a penalty</li>
                <li>Drop Goal - 3 points - Kicked out of the hand, to bounce off the floor and then be kicked through the posts</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Each team has 15 players</li>
        <li>The ball must be passed backwards, but can be kicked forwards</li>
        <li>The defneding team can tackle the call carrier down to the ground, as long as they hit below the sternum</li>
        <li>There are three types of 'set play' in a game of rugby union:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Scrum - following a knock on or penalty, the forwards form a bridge to push against each other and fight for the ball that is under their feet</li>
            <li>Lineout - when the ball goes over the sideline, it is thrown back in where two lines of each team are formed and they both try to reach for the ball</li>
            <li>Maul - Formed when the tackled person cannot get to the ground, where players from both team 'bind on' and aim to push in opposing directions down the pitch</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Playing positions</h3>
    <p>Here is a list of the numbers that all correspond to a different position, and if they have any special role</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Loose head prop - left of front row in scrums</li>
        <li>Hooker - throws in balls from sideline at lineouts, middle of front row in scrums</li>
        <li>Tight head prop - right of front row in scrums</li>
        <li>Lock - left of second row in scrums</li>
        <li>Lock - right of second row in scrums</li>
        <li>Flanker - to the left of and behind left lock in scrums</li>
        <li>Flanker - to the right of and behind right lock in scrums</li>
        <li>Number 8 - the back row in the scrum</li>
        <li>Scrum half - will handle balls that are presented at the back of rucks, often relied on to box kick ball up the pitch</li>
        <li>Fly half - often (but not necessarily) the player who kicks to the posts</li>
        <li>Left wing - super speedy</li>
        <li>Inside center - the thinker</li>
        <li>Outside center - support full back and strategy choices</li>
        <li>Right wing - super duper speedy</li>
        <li>Full back - Supporting from the back</li>
    </ol>
